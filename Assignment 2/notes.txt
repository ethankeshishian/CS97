2.1:
  The result of 2^3^4 does not fit in a 64-bit integer.
  Running C-h k C-h k runs the describe command on the keysequence C-h k, which is the describe command keybinding.
  Running C-h k M-SPC runs the describe command on the keysequence M-SPC, which is the keybinding for the command that deletes all but one space around text.
  The general command is cycle-spacing, which cylces through deleting all but one space, deleting all spaces, and revering back to the way it was.

HW:
  Running with python 2 gives an error that the list index is out of range. This is because the file is empty.
  Running with python 3 gives a syntax error. The file was meant to run with python 2 and is incompatible.
  I expected it to not work because of the print statement, but it did run on python 2 with the same output.
