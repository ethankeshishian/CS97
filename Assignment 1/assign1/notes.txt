1.1:
  C-s can be used to search for the words. M-< took me back to the start of the file.
  I used C-p, C-n, C-b, and C-f for up, down, left, and right respectively.
1.4:
  There were 5 "-->" symbols that were replaced with "--&gt". There was a sixth one which was the one I added, which wasn't replaced.
  There were 6 occurances of "<ol> that were replaced with "<oL>".
1.5:
  1. Using 'which mv' and 'which sh' shows 'sh' in /usr/bin/sh and 'mv' in /usr/local/cs/bin/mv.
  2. Using ls | grep ^r%, I found ar, pr, tr. 
     'man ar' says 'ar' is 'The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.
     'pr' is used to make pages and columns for printing.
     'tr' translates and deletes characters.
  3. In reality, /etc/alternatives/emacs is executed.
  4. The version in /usr/bin/gcc is 4.8.5. The plain version is located at /usr/local/cs/bin and is version 10.2.0. This is version installed for the local user
  5. u+sx adds permissions to the user who owns the file to execute and set the user ID on execution. o-w removes permissions two write from other users not in the group.
  6. find -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime -28 returns:
    .
    ./bin
    ./ocaml-4.11.1
    ./bash-5.0.18
    ./grep-3.5
    ./Python-2.7.18
    ./Python-3.9.0
  7. ls -al | grep -Fc -- '->' returns 280 lines.
  8. Using 'ls -alt' the oldest file is librom1394.so.0.3.0.
  9. man locale shows /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive and /usr/share/i18n/locales.
 10. downcase-dwim, downcase-region, and downcase-word.
 11. C-M-r is a backwards regex search. C-M-s is a forward regex search. C-M-t transposes sexps. C-M-u goes back a level of parentheses. C-M-v scrolls the next window.
 12. C-g sends a signal to 'quit'.
 13. 'yank' is a paste function. It can be invoked with C-y.
 14. Both are very similar, with different colors. ls adds single quotes around the first entry. Emacs is interactive.
