Set up:
* To set the repo up, I created a new repo with the command:
  npx create-react-app chorus-lapilli
* I deleted everything in the src folder.
* I copied index.js and index.css from the tic-tac-toe game into src.
* I used npm start and went to http://localhost:3000/ to see the game.

Modifications:
* My first modification was to prevent a fourth piece.
* I began by modifying handleClick().
* First, I isolated the standard tic-tac-toe logic.
* I made it so that the game was normal if stepNumber < 6, (X's fourth move).
* I added a selectedSquare variable to the state. This is normally null.
* After 6 moves, the user has to select a piece before moving it.
* This updates selectedSquare. Then, if selectedSquare !== null,
the user can choose a second square to move to, if it's null.
* Now, I tested out the game. The piece could be moved anywhere.
* I limited movement by adding a checkIfEligibleSquare() function.
This function takes in the old location and new location. Allowed locations
are hard programmed into the function. An array is filled with legal locations
and if this array .includes() the new location, the function returns true.
* Using this function, I limited movement to only legal locations.
* The game was working, and the first requirement of the game was met.
* Now, to do the second, and make sure the middle square was vacated,
I added logic before everything before, but only in the stepNumber > 6
section. This checked if the middle square was occupied by the current player.
If it was, the function would return early. They have to move that piece.
* The game was working correctly, but I noticed a bug where a piece
could be moved to a location marked by the opponent. I fixed this by
fixing the logic before the if statements dealing with selecting pieces.
* The game was working correctly now. I tested it by trying to move
pieces to illegal locations, moving the opponents pieces, etc.
I didn't find any bugs.
