Installation:
* I already had Node.js installed. I created a new app with the command:
  npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe
* I cleared out the src/ folder with the VS Code GUI.
* I copied over the started code into two new files.
* I used "npm start" then went to http://localhost:3000 to see the project.

Building the game:
* I followed the instructions, copying code by manually typing. 
* After each change, I made sure to understand what the changes were doing.
* First, I moved the state logic of Square to Board.
* I defined the handleClick() function.
* I followed a link to "Optimizing Performance" and did some more reading.
* I changed Square to a function component.
* I added turn logic, and updated the status text.
* Finally, I added logic to determine a winner. I did this by:
  adding a calculateWinner() function, and
  updating the handleClick() and render() methods
* The first part of the game was finished, and worked when I tested it.
* I played the game for a while before moving on to time travel...

Time travel:
* I lifted the state up again to Game, then added the history array.
* To lift state, I removed Board's constructor and gave it props.
* I also moved the handleClick() method to Game.
* I added buttons to show past moves. They appear number of moves increase.
* I added key={move} to the list of buttons to remove a React warning.
* I also added a stepNumber variable to Game's state, and a jumpTo() method.
* jumpTo() takes the game back in time.
* I modifed the handleClick() method to work with this and allow time travel.
* I added const current to render() to render the correct move.
* The game wasn't working. I looked through my code and found a missing line.
* The game was now fully finished, and worked correctly.
