1. In the top left box, I can see a graphic representation of the repository. This commit was a merge. In the middle column, I can see the authors of the commits. This commit was authored by Glenn Morris. In the right column, I can see the date and time of the commit, which was 2020-10-17 09:48:54.
The lower half of the window is split into two parts. On the left, I can see additional information about the merge, like git diff information. This can be changed with a couple of options. On the right there are options to explore the repository at this point in time.

3. The fresh repository only has the master branch saved locally. The emacs repository in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs has many branches saved locally. It could be that the repository in ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs has permissions to view other branches, because running git fetch and git pull in the new repository did not add branches. It could also be that those branches are all only stored locally, and don't exist in the remote.
